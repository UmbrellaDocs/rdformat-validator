# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Reviewdog Diagnostic Format (RDFormat) Validator is a NodeJS library designed to validate input against the Reviewdog Diagnostic Format specification. The library will provide functionality to validate RDFormat JSON data, report errors in the format, and optionally fix and output corrected RDFormat data. The tool will be usable both as a NodeJS library that can be imported into other projects and as a standalone CLI tool.

## Requirements

### 1. Core Validation Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate if my JSON data conforms to the Reviewdog Diagnostic Format, so that I can ensure my diagnostic data is correctly formatted before processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides JSON input THEN the system SHALL validate it against the Reviewdog Diagnostic Format specification.
2. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL check all required fields according to the RDFormat specification.
3. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify data types of all fields.
4. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify the structure of nested objects.
5. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify that array fields contain valid elements.
6. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages indicating which parts of the input failed validation.
7. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return a success indicator.

### 2. Error Reporting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive detailed error reports when my data doesn't conform to RDFormat, so that I can identify and fix issues in my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors are found THEN the system SHALL report the location of each error in the input data.
2. WHEN validation errors are found THEN the system SHALL provide a description of each error.
3. WHEN validation errors are found THEN the system SHALL indicate the expected format or value type.
4. WHEN multiple errors are found THEN the system SHALL report all errors, not just the first one.
5. WHEN errors are reported THEN the system SHALL use a consistent error reporting format.

### 3. Error Correction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the option to automatically fix common formatting issues in my RDFormat data, so that I can quickly correct my data without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables the fix option THEN the system SHALL attempt to correct common formatting issues.
2. WHEN the system corrects an issue THEN the system SHALL log what was corrected.
3. WHEN the system cannot automatically fix an issue THEN the system SHALL report that the issue requires manual correction.
4. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL output the corrected RDFormat data.
5. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure the output is valid according to the RDFormat specification.
6. WHEN the fix option is not enabled THEN the system SHALL only report errors without modifying the input.

### 4. Library Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the validator as a library in my NodeJS projects, so that I can integrate RDFormat validation into my existing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is installed via npm THEN the system SHALL provide importable modules for validation functionality.
2. WHEN the library is imported THEN the system SHALL expose a clear API for validation functions.
3. WHEN the library is used THEN the system SHALL support both CommonJS and ES Module import patterns.
4. WHEN the library is used THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript type definitions.
5. WHEN the library is used THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of validation options.
6. WHEN the library is used THEN the system SHALL provide programmatic access to validation results.
7. WHEN the library is used THEN the system SHALL allow error handling through standard JavaScript patterns (promises/callbacks).

### 5. Command Line Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the validator as a CLI tool, so that I can quickly validate RDFormat files without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is installed globally THEN the system SHALL provide a command-line executable.
2. WHEN the CLI tool is run THEN the system SHALL accept input from files specified as arguments.
3. WHEN the CLI tool is run THEN the system SHALL accept input from stdin when no file is specified.
4. WHEN the CLI tool is run THEN the system SHALL support command-line options to control validation behavior.
5. WHEN the CLI tool is run with a --fix option THEN the system SHALL output corrected RDFormat.
6. WHEN the CLI tool is run without a --fix option THEN the system SHALL only report validation errors.
7. WHEN the CLI tool is run with a --output option THEN the system SHALL write results to the specified file.
8. WHEN the CLI tool is run without a --output option THEN the system SHALL write results to stdout.
9. WHEN the CLI tool encounters errors THEN the system SHALL exit with appropriate error codes.

### 6. Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the validator to be performant and reliable, so that I can use it in production environments and CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating large files THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable performance.
2. WHEN encountering malformed JSON THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages.
3. WHEN encountering unexpected input THEN the system SHALL not crash.
4. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL handle each file independently.
5. WHEN used in automated environments THEN the system SHALL have predictable resource usage.

### 7. Edge Case Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle edge cases in the validation process, so that my validation is robust and reliable in all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input is empty THEN the system SHALL provide a specific error message.
2. WHEN input contains partial or incomplete RDFormat data THEN the system SHALL identify and report the specific missing elements.
3. WHEN input contains extra fields not in the RDFormat specification THEN the system SHALL report them as warnings but not fail validation.
4. WHEN input contains extremely large files THEN the system SHALL handle them without memory issues.
5. WHEN input contains special characters or Unicode THEN the system SHALL process them correctly.
6. WHEN input contains deeply nested structures THEN the system SHALL validate them correctly without stack overflow issues.

### 8. Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation for the validator, so that I can quickly learn how to use it effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is published THEN the system SHALL include a README with basic usage examples.
2. WHEN the package is published THEN the system SHALL include API documentation for library usage.
3. WHEN the package is published THEN the system SHALL include CLI documentation with all available options.
4. WHEN the package is published THEN the system SHALL include examples of common use cases.
5. WHEN the package is published THEN the system SHALL include information about the Reviewdog Diagnostic Format specification.
